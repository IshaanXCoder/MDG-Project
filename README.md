# Canteen KIOSK 🍴

Canteen Kiosk is designed to address the common issues faced in traditional canteen systems. Our digital solution simplifies the ordering process by providing an intuitive interface on a tablet. Users can easily browse food categories, select items, and place their orders, all while receiving a unique token number for accurate order fulfillment. 

The system efficiently organizes queues and adheres to a first-come-first-serve basis, which reduces wait times and prevents the confusion of misplaced orders. By modernizing the canteen experience, the Canteen Kiosk aims to enhance efficiency, minimize errors, and improve overall user satisfaction.
